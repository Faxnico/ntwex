![NTWEX Logo](link_to_your_logo.png)

## Introduction

NTWEX is a plugin/DLL for Napoleon Total War that aims to extend and corrects certain functionalities of the game developed by Creative Assembly. It was initially conceived to reintroduce the chat functionality, which was recently removed by Creative Assembly. Please note that using NTWEX is at your own risk, and you are solely responsible for any actions that occur within the chat.

## Disclaimer

The developer of NTWEX holds no liability for any consequences resulting from using this plugin. Modifying your game to restore the chat feature, as instance, is a personal and conscious choice, and any outcomes are your own responsibility.

## Third-Party Components

### Xenos (Windows DLL Injector)

NTWEX includes the `xenos.exe` tool, which is a Windows DLL injector. Xenos is distributed under the MIT License and can be found on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos).

## Installation

Extract the contents of the 7z archive into the directory where Napoleon Total War is installed.
Disregard any warnings from antivirus software, and consider adding necessary exceptions in your antivirus settings to prevent false positives.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the Steam client is up and running, as NTW requires it to access the multiplayer games area of the game.
2. Launch Napoleon Total War by running `ntwex/run.bat`.
3. The chat functionality should now be available, allowing you to communicate with other players in the multiplayer games area.
